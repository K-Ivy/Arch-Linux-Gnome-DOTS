> Ability to browse twitch via provided catergory, term, or top streamers to some degree.

> Option to retrieve streamers from follow list and put them in the streamers-list or to a new list.

> Quick lang option (no translations, just ability to easily do so).

> Option to append manually entered streamer to the streamers-list if they are valid.

> Option to launch a stream (and if possible vods) in the browser in popout mode so it's only the stream, no site, no chat. This is so browser adblock extensions work if wanted for a important stream.
